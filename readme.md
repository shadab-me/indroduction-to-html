Some Important Thing I get to Know

Elements - contains opening tags, content, closing tags; for example,  
<h1>Hello World!</h1>

Tag- marks the beginning and ending of an element. It consists of a less-than sign followed by an element’s name, and then ends with a greater-than sign; for example, `<p></p>`.

Attributes- provide some extra information about the element, which actually doesn’t appear as content in a webpage. An attribute defines a property for an element, consists of an attribute/value pair, and appears within the element’s start tag; for example, 
<a href="facebook.com">Facebook</a> 

Selector - A selector is an HTML tag at which a style will be applied. This could be any tag like `<h1>` or `<table>` etc.

Properties - a property determines the styles that will be applied to that element; for example, *color*, *border*, etc.
Values - Values are assigned to properties. For example, color property can have value either *red* or *#F1F1F1* etc.
